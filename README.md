# Morse-Code-Keyboard
Plays and prints Morse code in response to user input

Inspired by a conversation with my uncle and written as an early exercise in two-dimensional arrays, events, and printing, this short program plays the corresponding Morse code through the computer's speakers and prints its combination of dots and dashes to the console whenever an alphanumeric key is pressed on the keyboard.
